              <p>
                Subhash Chandra Bose was without a doubt one of the greatest Indian liberation fighters in history. He was famously known as Netaji. He was a fanatical nationalist whose supreme patriotism made him a hero. Bose was a member of the Indian freedom fighters’ extremist wing. From the early 1920s through the end of 1930, he was the leader of a radical young wing of Congress. Instead of thinking that only armed insurrection could drive the British out of India, Bose disagreed with Gandhi’s nonviolent beliefs. He was the creator of the Forward Bloc and managed to elude the British gaze long enough to reach Germany during world war II. He established the Indian National Army (INA)

              <p>
                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is revered as Father of the Nation for his immense sacrifices for India. He not only ushered India towards freedom, but he also became the inspiring figure for many independence struggles and rights movements across the world. Popularly called Bapu, Gandhi introduced the doctrine of non-violence in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved through a combination of non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British. The historic Non-Cooperation movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.
